# Chewbotcca for Discord

Chewbotcca for Discord is back and better than ever!
It is completely re-written in Java using the JDA Discord API library.

It aims to be exactly what the [Legacy Discord bot was](https://github.com/Chewbotcca/Discord-Legacy), and hopefully even better!

I hope you enjoy the bot and want to improve it :)

## What is it?

Chewbotcca is my multi-purpose bot for Discord, mostly with commands that I would like to use.

The goal of Chewbotcca isn't really to be the "best", its goal is to have features that I personally want in a Discord bot, and if you agree, you're free to add the bot yourself.

## What can it do?

It's mostly fun commands like `%^roll`ing some dice, getting cats with `%^cat`, and more.

However, it can also be used to find information like getting RubyGem information with `%^rubygem`, ironic considering this is a Java bot now.

It also has powerful server info commands, for example, you can run `%^sinfo bot` to find all bots on the server, and when they got added.

There's also commands such as `%^mixer` to get Mixer profiles, `%^youtube` to find YouTube videos, and `%^ghuser` to detail your favorite developers on GitHub.

I'm always open to suggestions on what to add, please let me know what you would like to see!
